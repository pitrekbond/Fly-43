## Usage
To be able to access the functional parts of the app, you need to register (if you haven't already) with Google account.
Fly 43 is a flight and hotel search engine - its purpose is to look for flight connections and hotel bookings, for which the user can later make a reservation (flights/hotels route). Then, inside "My trips" route you can check all your reservations, view its details (past and current reservations) or modify and delete them (future reservations). The flight and hotel data used in the project is not real-world. 
The user can also change the currency of displayed prices by clicking the button at the top of the page and update his profile by clicking the profile image. 


## Technologies Used
The project was created in Next.js + TypeScript, using Tailwind CSS for styling.
